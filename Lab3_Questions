How many LEDs do we need to display a count from 0 to 7? What about from 0 to 10?
2^3-1, so its 7




5. Lab Questions: Observe the behavior of the LEDs.

What do you notice as the seconds change from 0 to 59? And 59 to 0?



What do you notice as the seconds change count from 0 to 7? Is the behaviour always the same? Why?



How does the format(seconds, '06b') function work in formatting the binary representation?



What would you need to modify in the code if you wanted to use different GPIO pins for the LEDs?
