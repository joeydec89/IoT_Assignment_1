                  Reflections.

The goal of reflection logging is for you to take a step back and see what you must do to improve.

Write your reflection log file directly from the Web document editor in your GitHub account.

Think about labs 1, 2, and 3, as well as this assignment.

Think about the experience and write a few short sentences stating

what you have learned,
what you believe you need to improve,
what the teacher could have said or done to make learning easier,
what you could have done to make the learning easier, and
other reflections that you find relevant to your personal development.
Also, list the Linux and Git commands that you learned and write what you think they do exactly.
Now that you are done writing this document in the Web interface, go back to the command line interface, in the local repository folder and run.




Lab 1 & 2 we did in class and it was direct and pretty straight forward. as for me i find the Python Programming set up was rather difficult since proggramming isn't one of my strengths. what i did learn is an expansion of my knowledge of git hub, how to manouver 
and Navigate through the programming, how to upload files and keep organinzed.
Question: What the teacher could have done to make things easier?


Answer: Personally for me, i believe maybe a step-by-step on how to do the first lab, just to start us off and get the ball rolling. the assignments was pretty straight forward however 
when an error happens or when we get stuck in a situation that we are not familiar with, then it becomes difficult to navigate and execute the assignment effectivly & Effeciantly.
